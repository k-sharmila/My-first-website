Located in the centre of town, Ramanathaswamy Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva.There are sixty-four Tīrthas or Theerthams (holy water bodies) in and around Rameswaram.

The foremost one is called Agni Theertham, the sea (Bay of Bengal). Jatayu, King of the Birds, who fought in vain with the demon-king Ravana to save Sita, is said to have fallen down at Jadayu Theertham as his wings were severed.Villoondi Theertham literally translates to 'buried bow', is located around 7 kilometres from the main temple on the way to Pamban.
